# social-app1.0
This is my Spring Boot social application, which is currently in development. It includes an SQL database connection using JPA/Hibernate to which all data is saved. The frontend is created using Thymeleaf/jQuery. Its functionality includes a login/register profile system in witch you can also add friends to your  profile, share songs and images and comment on each one of them.
